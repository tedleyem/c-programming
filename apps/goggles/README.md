# Goggles
A command-line hardware information tool written in C 

to grab detailed information on each piece of hardware and Advanced PC insights.

Inspired by [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) and [neofetch](https://github.com/tedleyem/goggles), written in C because I wanted to learn C and felt like it.
