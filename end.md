### Plan to Learn and Build a Linux Character Device Driver by September 30, 2025

#### Goal
Develop a functional Linux character device driver (e.g., a simple driver that allows user-space applications to read/write data to a kernel buffer) and document the process to strengthen your portfolio.

#### Prerequisites
- **Skills**: Basic C programming (pointers, memory management, file operations) and introductory kernel module development (from your `kernel-hello-module`).
- **Tools**: A Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or a VM), GCC, `make`, kernel headers, and Git for version control.
- **Time Commitment**: ~10-15 hours per week, adjustable based on your schedule.

---

### Week-by-Week Plan

#### Week 1 (August 25 - August 31, 2025): Understand Device Drivers and Set Up Environment
**Objective**: Gain a conceptual understanding of device drivers and prepare your development environment.

1. **Learn Device Driver Basics (3-4 hours)**:
   - **What to Study**: Focus on character device drivers, which are simpler than block or network drivers. Understand their role in mediating between user-space applications and kernel-space hardware (or virtual devices).
     - **Definition**: A character device driver manages devices that handle data streams (e.g., serial ports, virtual devices) without buffering large data blocks.
     - **Key Concepts**: Device files (`/dev`), major/minor numbers, file operations (`open`, `read`, `write`, `release`), and kernel module structure.
   - **Resources**:
     - Read *Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition* (LDD3), Chapters 1-3 (available free online).
     - Watch a beginner-friendly video, e.g., "Linux Device Drivers" on YouTube or KernelNewbies.org tutorials.
     - Review your `kernel-hello-module` code to connect module basics (`init_module`, `exit_module`) to driver concepts.

2. **Set Up Development Environment (2-3 hours)**:
   - **Tasks**:
     - Ensure your Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu) has kernel headers (`sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)`), GCC, and `make`.
     - Clone your `kernel-hello-module` repo and verify it compiles/runs (`make`, `insmod`, `dmesg`).
     - Install `libudev-dev` and `dmidecode` for potential hardware interaction (from your prior hardware extraction work).
   - **Output**: A working setup where you can build and test kernel modules.

3. **Start a New GitHub Repo (1 hour)**:
   - Create a new repository (e.g., `tedleyem/simple-char-driver`) for your driver project.
   - Initialize with a README documenting your goal and weekly progress.

**Deliverable**: A clear understanding of character device drivers and a configured development environment. Commit an initial README to your new repo.

#### Week 2 (September 1 - September 7, 2025): Learn Character Driver Basics and Write a Skeleton Driver
**Objective**: Understand the structure of a character device driver and build a minimal version.

1. **Study Character Driver Components (4-5 hours)**:
   - **Topics**:
     - File operations structure (`struct file_operations`) and its key functions (`open`, `read`, `write`, `release`).
     - Registering a character device using `register_chrdev` or `alloc_chrdev_region`.
     - Creating a device file with `mknod` or `class_create`/`device_create`.
   - **Resources**:
     - LDD3, Chapter 3: "Character Device Drivers."
     - KernelNewbies.org: "Writing a Simple Character Device Driver."
     - Your `kernel-hello-module` repo, which already uses `printk` and module macros.

2. **Write a Skeleton Character Driver (3-4 hours)**:
   - **Tasks**:
     - Start with your `kernel-hello-module` code as a base.
     - Write a driver that:
       - Registers a major number using `register_chrdev`.
       - Implements empty `open` and `release` functions that print messages to `dmesg`.
       - Cleans up on module exit.
     - Example skeleton:
       ```c
       #include <linux/module.h>
       #include <linux/fs.h>
       #include <linux/device.h>

       #define DEVICE_NAME "mychardev"
       static int major_num;

       static int dev_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file) {
           printk(KERN_INFO "mychardev: Device opened\n");
           return 0;
       }

       static int dev_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file) {
           printk(KERN_INFO "mychardev: Device closed\n");
           return 0;
       }

       static struct file_operations fops = {
           .open = dev_open,
           .release = dev_release,
       };

       static int __init mychardev_init(void) {
           major_num = register_chrdev(0, DEVICE_NAME, &fops);
           if (major_num < 0) {
               printk(KERN_ALERT "mychardev: Registration failed: %d\n", major_num);
               return major_num;
           }
           printk(KERN_INFO "mychardev: Registered with major number %d\n", major_num);
           return 0;
       }

       static void __exit mychardev_exit(void) {
           unregister_chrdev(major_num, DEVICE_NAME);
           printk(KERN_INFO "mychardev: Unregistered\n");
       }

       module_init(mychardev_init);
       module_exit(mychardev_exit);
       MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
       ```
   - **Test**:
     - Compile and load the module (`make`, `insmod`).
     - Create a device file: `sudo mknod /dev/mychardev c <major_num> 0`.
     - Test opening the device: `sudo cat /dev/mychardev` (should trigger `open` message in `dmesg`).

3. **Commit to GitHub (1 hour)**:
   - Push the skeleton driver code to your repo with a clear commit message.
   - Update the README with setup instructions and test results.

**Deliverable**: A working skeleton character driver that registers with the kernel and logs open/release events.

#### Week 3 (September 8 - September 14, 2025): Implement Read/Write Functionality
**Objective**: Add data transfer capabilities to your driver using a kernel buffer.

1. **Learn Read/Write Operations (3-4 hours)**:
   - **Topics**:
     - Implementing `read` and `write` in `struct file_operations`.
     - Using a kernel buffer to store data.
     - Handling user-space to kernel-space data transfer with `copy_to_user` and `copy_from_user`.
   - **Resources**:
     - LDD3, Chapter 3: Section on file operations.
     - Online example: "Simple Linux Character Device Driver" on GitHub or KernelNewbies.org.

2. **Add Read/Write to Your Driver (4-5 hours)**:
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add a static kernel buffer (e.g., `char buffer[256]`) to store data.
     - Implement `read` and `write` functions:
       ```c
       static char buffer[256] = {0};
       static size_t buffer_size = 0;

       static ssize_t dev_read(struct file *file, char __user *buf, size_t len, loff_t *offset) {
           if (*offset >= buffer_size)
               return 0;
           len = min(len, buffer_size - (size_t)(*offset));
           if (copy_to_user(buf, buffer + *offset, len))
               return -EFAULT;
           *offset += len;
           printk(KERN_INFO "mychardev: Read %zu bytes\n", len);
           return len;
       }

       static ssize_t dev_write(struct file *file, const char __user *buf, size_t len, loff_t *offset) {
           if (len > sizeof(buffer))
               len = sizeof(buffer);
           if (copy_from_user(buffer, buf, len))
               return -EFAULT;
           buffer_size = len;
           *offset += len;
           printk(KERN_INFO "mychardev: Wrote %zu bytes\n", len);
           return len;
       }
       ```
     - Update `fops` to include `.read = dev_read, .write = dev_write`.
   - **Test**:
     - Write to the device: `echo "Hello" | sudo tee /dev/mychardev`.
     - Read from the device: `sudo cat /dev/mychardev`.
     - Verify via `dmesg` and check that the buffer content is correctly read/written.

3. **Commit and Document (1 hour)**:
   - Push code changes to GitHub.
   - Update README with instructions for testing read/write functionality.

**Deliverable**: A character driver with functional read/write operations, capable of storing and retrieving data from a kernel buffer.

#### Week 4 (September 15 - September 21, 2025): Enhance and Test the Driver
**Objective**: Add features, handle errors, and thoroughly test the driver.

1. **Enhance the Driver (3-4 hours)**:
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add basic error handling (e.g., check for invalid pointers, buffer overflows).
     - Implement `ioctl` for custom commands (optional, if time allows):
       - Define a simple `ioctl` command to clear the buffer.
       - Example: `ioctl(file, MYCHARDEV_IOC_CLEAR, NULL)` to reset `buffer_size`.
     - Add a device class and automatic device file creation:
       ```c
       static struct class *dev_class;
       static struct device *dev_device;

       // In init:
       dev_class = class_create(THIS_MODULE, "mychardev_class");
       dev_device = device_create(dev_class, NULL, MKDEV(major_num, 0), NULL, DEVICE_NAME);

       // In exit:
       device_destroy(dev_class, MKDEV(major_num, 0));
       class_destroy(dev_class);
       ```
   - **Resources**: LDD3, Chapter 3, or search "Linux device class creation" online.

2. **Test Thoroughly (2-3 hours)**:
   - **Tasks**:
     - Write a user-space C program to test the driver (leverage your `c-programming` repo skills):
       ```c
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       int main() {
           int fd = open("/dev/mychardev", O_RDWR);
           if (fd < 0) {
               perror("Failed to open device");
               return 1;
           }
           char write_buf[] = "Test data";
           char read_buf[256];
           write(fd, write_buf, sizeof(write_buf));
           read(fd, read_buf, sizeof(read_buf));
           printf("Read: %s\n", read_buf);
           close(fd);
           return 0;
       }
       ```
     - Test edge cases: empty reads, large writes, multiple open/close cycles.
     - Use `dmesg` to debug issues.

3. **Commit and Document (1 hour)**:
   - Push enhanced driver and test program to GitHub.
   - Update README with test program instructions and example outputs.

**Deliverable**: A robust character driver with automatic device file creation, error handling, and a user-space test program.
