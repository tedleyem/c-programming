### CHARACTER DRIVERS 
what are character drivers: Character drivers are basically a bytes stream of drivers being handled. File operations, console drivers, embedded systems like UART and more can be considered as character drivers. 

- Character transactions from kernel to userspace and vice-versa 
- Entry are found in /dev 
- Typical character drivers are serial drivers and console drivers. 
- Character devices are identified by a 'c'.

-- Finding character drivers 
$ ls -l /dev/ 


# QUICK BUILD STEPS 
### RELOAD MODULE
- sudo make -C /usr/src/linux-headers-6.12.30-amd64/ M=~/projects/c-programming/hellomodule/
- grep hello_module /proc/modules 
- grep hello_module /proc/kallsyms 
- 

###
# CHARACTER DRIVER NUMBERS 
###
--- Major number and Minor number
- Numbers exist in pairs 
- Can be found for each type of devices under /dev.
- The major numbers are used by the kernel to identify the correct driver whenever the device is accessed. 
- Minor number is device dependent and is internally handled within the driver 

Ex: sudo mknod /dev/testdriver c 92 1 

Command: sudo mknod 
driver entry: /dev/testdriver 
Type of driver: c 
Major number: 92 
minor number: 1 

To find the differences in Character devices and Block devices 
you can type in:
$ cat /proc/devics 


 
tmeralus@mercury:~/projects/c-programming/linux-6.15/drivers(main)$ cat /proc/devices

If you wanted to creat a driver with a device number you can check the list 
and find a number thats not being used. 

ID 200 is not being used so we can use that. 

$ sudo mknod /dev/my_test_driver c 200 5

this command creates an ENTRY file NOT a driver 
you can check for that if you look for /dev/my_test_driver 

###
# REGISTER A DEVICE DRIVER 
###

- Registering a driver 
    register_chrdev(major number, Device_name, &file_operations)
- requires the major number
- - if the major number is not known, use 0 to dynamically find the major number. 
- reuqires the name of the driver 
- requires file operation as the parameter 

###
# FILE OPERATIONS 
###

you can find how other developers created file operations by searching through the linux kernel 
source tree. 

ex: grep -r file_operations * /projects/c-programming/linux-6.15/drivers
ex: cat /projects/c-programming/linux-6.15/drivers/scsi/st.c 

# fun command -- cat scsi/st.c | tail -n 820 | head -40  
static const struct file_operations st_fops =
{
        .owner =        THIS_MODULE,
        .read =         st_read,
        .write =        st_write,
        .unlocked_ioctl = st_ioctl,
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
        .compat_ioctl = st_compat_ioctl,
#endif
        .open =         st_open,
        .flush =        st_flush,
        .release =      st_release,
        .llseek =       noop_llseek,
};

# BUILD CHARACTER DRIVER 
in the make file add this line 

$ obj-m:= character_driver.o
